# Guidelines for the Project Rushmore
Guidelines and conventions are just there to organize work and make everyones life better. Nobody has to like every single rule and they are not written in stone, but lets try to be civilized. The general guidelines for this project can change from repository to repository, but we always try to be consistent.

This project is just beginning, so the rules of the game can change. Until stable, I will be very happy to listen to your suggestions. When the project matures, It will be more difficult to make amends, but while Iâ€™m part of it, I will strive to make everyone welcome to suggest any reasonable change. 



## Code of Conduct

We are proudly part of the Contributor Covenant. To know what that mean, please check our [Code of Conduct Pledge](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).



## Principles 

Software development is far from being the arid landscape some people love to paint. We live software development and this is made clear on our very human choices. None of the principles here is intended to be seem as the truth. They are choices and beliefs that appear to be reasonable and may naturally change over time. Please, read the [principles](PRINCIPLES.md) of this projects and if are not convinced, I open to listen, review and add. But be sure to have a nice explanation. 



## Conventions

Conventions are all about putting everyone in the same page and make our sanity the first priority. As the case with the principles, different people like different things. Respect the conventions and if there is something to add or change, a good talk can solve our problems.  So read the [conventions](CONVENTIONS.md).



## Comments

For now, I prepared some [comment templates](COMMENTS.md) for C++ comments based on Doxygen. Later it will be expanded to other languages such Python, Javascript and Go.



## Workflow

At the moment, the project is in a very early stage.  The [workflow](WORKFLOW.md) file is ready to use, but it will only be useful in the future.
